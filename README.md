# RegExp Match Indices for ECMAScript

ECMAScript `RegExp` Match Indices provide additional information about the start and end
indices of captured substrings relative to the start of the input string.

A polyfill can be found in the [`regexp-match-indices`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/regexp-match-indices) package on NPM.

> NOTE: This proposal was previously named "RegExp Match Array Offsets", but has been renamed

# Motivations

Today, ECMAScript `RegExp` objects can provide information about a _match_ when calling the `exec`
method. This result is an `Array` containing information about the substrings that were matched,
along with additional properties to indicate the `input` string, the `index` in the input at which
the match was found, as well as a `groups` object containing the substrings for any named capture
groups.

However, there are several more advanced scenarios where this information may not necessarily be
sufficient. For example, an ECMAScript implementation of TextMate Language syntax highlighting
needs more than just the `index` of the _match_, but also the start and end indices for individual
capture groups.

As such, we propose the adoption of an additional `indices` property on the array result (the 
_substrings array_) of the RegExpBuiltInExec abstract operation (and thus the result from 
`RegExp.prototype.exec()`, `String.prototype.match`, etc.). This property would itself be an _indices array_ 
containing a pair of start and end indices for each captured substring. Any _unmatched_ capture 
groups would be `undefined`, similar to their corresponding element in the _substrings array_. 
In addition, the _indices array_ would itself have a `groups` property containing the start and end
indices for each named capture group.

> NOTE: For performance reasons, `indices` will only be added to the result if the `d` flag is specified.

## Why Use `d` For the RegExp Flag

We chose `d` due to its presence in the word `indices`, which is the basis for the naming of the feature (i.e.,
`lastIndex` on a RegExp, `index` on a match, etc. The character `i` is already in use for ignore-case, and `n` has
precedence in other engines for handling capturing vs. non-capturing groups. This is similar to the "sticky" flag 
using the `y` character, since `s` was used for dot-all.

**Why not use `o` and `offsets` instead of `d` and `indices`?** Our goal is to align the name of the property 
with the existing nomenclature on RegExp (i.e., `lastIndex` and `index`).

**Does `d` have a different meaning in other engines?** Yes and no. For the few engines that *do* have a `d` flag 
(Onigmo, Perl, and java.util.regex), the meanings differ. Onigmo and Perl both use the `d` flag for 
backwards-compatiblity (and Perl's documentation seems strongly worded towards discouraging its use), while 
java.util.regex uses `d` for the treatment of new-line handling. You can find a full list of the flags supported 
by 46 different RegExp engines in [flags_comparison.md](./flags_comparison.md).

```js
const re1 = /a+(?<Z>z)?/d;

// indices are relative to start of the input string:
const s1 = "xaaaz";
const m1 = re1.exec(s1);
m1.indices[0][0] === 1;
m1.indices[0][1] === 5;
s1.slice(...m1.indices[0]) === "aaaz";

m1.indices[1][0] === 4;
m1.indices[1][1] === 5;
s1.slice(...m1.indices[1]) === "z";

m1.indices.groups["Z"][0] === 4;
m1.indices.groups["Z"][1] === 5;
s1.slice(...m1.indices.groups["Z"]) === "z";

// capture groups that are not matched return `undefined`:
const m2 = re1.exec("xaaay");
m2.indices[1] === undefined;
m2.indices.groups["Z"] === undefined;
